Message for rlwrap $1:

Here is a nice configuration example for wrapping a command with rlwrap, the
command in this example being sqlplus, this would go into your ~/.bashrc:

    alias sqlplus="rlwrap -i -f ~/.sqlplus_history -H ~/.sqlplus_history -s 30000 sqlplus --"
    touch ~/.sqlplus_history

Enjoy!
