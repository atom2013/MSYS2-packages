Subject: [PATCH 27/N] fixup! Add functionality for converting UNIX paths in
 arguments and environment variables to Windows form for native Win32
 applications.

This reinstates the MSYS=wincmdln functionality that was inadvertently
broken by the patch: with that setting, all processes spawned by MSYS2
are supposed to fill the CommandLine field in the process information so
that e.g. `wmic process list` can see it (otherwise, only the executable
itself is listed in the command line, but all the arguments are
missing).
